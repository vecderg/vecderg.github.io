I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Vecderg/" target="_blank">a Youtube channel</a> that's existed since 2015!
I don't currently consider it to be one of my primary occupations, but it's what I used to be known for.<br>
<br>
Since I upload whatever I want on Youtube (and have a dark history of making... SMASH BROS tutorials...), it might
be a little difficult to scroll through! I wanted to highlight some of my favorite and most important videos.

This is currently my most-viewed video! It's a sort of tutorial birthed out of my experience from drawing with 
a computer mouse for about 2 years straight. I'm very happy that this one blew up because it's important to me --
I'm a strong believer in succeeding no matter what tools you have, and in people pushing past what they think
they're capable of with nothing but passion and a strong will.</p>

This video is the summary of my years of experience and study on fighting games. My editing/audio was pretty rough
since I was still figuring things out, but the core information is something that defines a lot of my philosophy
and understanding of fighting games and PvP as a whole. Many thanks to my friend who agreed to help edit parts 
of the video, whose handle is now @FloofyTreats.</p>

<p class="normal" style="font-size:20px">
I had to include this one. This is the announcement of my trailer for DracoFighter, my first Steam release! I had 
to throw it together rather quickly since I was caught off guard by Steam's requirement to include a video trailer, 
so I commissioned my friend to make trailer music (which I think was also a bit of a first-time thing for him) to sync the 
video with. The video underperformed by a bit, but it was monumental in getting me traction on Steam and Reddit.</p>

<p class="normal" style="font-size:20px">
Another video that I'm glad popped off! I had a friend that was intimidated by vectors, and I really wanted to show 
everyone how much easier and accessible vectors were in Clip Studio Paint, so I got this video together. It seemed to 
help a lot of people, and I'm always happy to get more people into vector art. This one has a more relaxed style with 
much less editing, which made it a lot more fun to make. (you can also ignore the all caps titles, i kept using those
because it kept working LOL)</p>

At the time of writing, this remains my only true animation video on Youtube. It touched on a lot of the abstract 
stuff I wanted to draw/create at the time, especially with its use of mixed media (2D animation + 3D physics + audio waves).
It was one of those animation pieces I was perfectly OK with just throwing out there, but there were a surprising number of 
people who seemed to like it.</p>

<p class="normal" style="font-size:20px">
This one underperformed compared to my expectations, but I really wanted to make a beginner introduction to vectors as a 
general concept since it was a common question I received. Other than the fact that I don't like how those Pluck sprites look,
I think the video generally stands up to today.</p>

<br>
<p class="normal" style="font-size:20px">
This one also underperformed compared to my expectations. It was also made since my friends were struggling with animation in 
Clip Studio Paint, even though I find the functions very simple when you understand them, but this one didn't seem to help many people.
Regardless, I still stand by the information in this tutorial and consider it important.</p>

<b><a class="normal" target="_blank" style="text-align:center" href="https://youtu.be/CFowVmnSc7E">How to Play Bomberman! Basics & Advanced Techniques</a></b><br>

<br>
<p class="normal" style="font-size:20px">
I had a huge Bomberman resurgence phase, partly fueled by that one 8hr Bomberman Youtube documentary, and partly due to Super 
Bomberman R Online being free to play. However, I realized there were almost ZERO resources on competitive Bomberman play, which felt 
very unusual, especially as a fighting game player (I know Bomberman is generally a party game, but R Online had a ranked system!). 
While I don't introduce anything ground-breaking in this video, I hoped to make a good starting point for people, and the video
did pretty well!</p>

<b><a class="normal" target="_blank" style="text-align:center" href="https://youtu.be/m-so8kieajs">Inkscape Tutorial for ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS</a></b><br>

<br>
<p class="normal" style="font-size:20px">
This video aged a lot, but after using Inkscape for so long, I really did hope to introduce more people to the program, 
especially since it wasn't considered very accessible. I was happy at the time it came out, but I would not recommend this 
guide for anyone today lol. Regardless, it remains one of my most-watched videos.</p>

<p class="normal" style="font-size:20px">
Mainly posting this as a relic. It's the first properly edited video on my channel, and remains one of my most-viewed
videos. While I don't enjoy looking at my old videos very much, this set the standard for a lot of my future Yoshi content.</p>
