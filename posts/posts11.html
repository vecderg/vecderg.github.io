It's finally HEEEEEREEE! <br />
<br />
My auxlang Dasopya has announced its official 1.0 release on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3lcbvsg3op22d" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/auxlangs/comments/1h4ivm6/dasopya_10_stability_announcement/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>! That means the language will now be paused for any major changes (other than vocab additions), meaning that it'll be safe to learn from and create Dasopya content.<br />
<br />
The language will probably still get changes in the future, but it will take much more time and consideration than previous changes. Either way, all changes will be recorded in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c64g6Yftybzoe9KeHm_WyeTTtMec23YiMDap351RxFw/" target="_blank">the spreadsheet</a>. Please consider giving <a href="https://www.dasopya.com/" target="_blank">the main website</a> a look -- Dasopya has been my big project for the last several months!<br />
<br />
Other than that, I have a bunch of assorted news to show.<br />
<br />
New articles:<br />
-  <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/fightingsimple" target="_blank">Opinion: Why Fighting Games are Simple, Actually</a> <br />
-  <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/esperantoenglish" target="_blank">Learn Esperanto by Doing Nothing</a> <br />
-  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCqJVoZOZwz1AEm6L2rh7YBKMR6VXKGdFjwPdQMTPHc/" target="_blank">Behind Dasopya</a> (personal thoughts/feelings on the language, Google Doc) <br />
<br />
I have another ref sheet commission for my good friend Eijin, only on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3lbdpgdqohs2x" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.<br />
<br />
I updated the kyle2023 ARG so that it's still possible to solve, since it was broken from various changes between Twitter, Discord, and Cohost. Like before, you can start the hunt from <a href="https://vecderg.itch.io/kyle2023" target="_blank">the Itch page</a>. I've also reposted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3lbgjwbfrw22j" target="_blank">the kyle14 ref sheets</a> for anyone to catch up on the lore before next year's event!<br />
<br />
It's also still a work in progress, but I might as well show off the preview for <a href="https://vecderg.github.io/kutokopo/dasopya.html" target="_blank">my "Wikibooks" course for Dasopya</a>, which I made from scratch since I wasn't sure if it'd be approved for the actual website. Am I making too many tutorials for this language? Maybe, but I also wanted more material for the language that wasn't just more Google Docs and Google Sites lol <br />
<br />
But yeah, that's about it! I only have one thing left on my list and that's Sonja Lang following me on Bluesky which is awesome but I'm not really sure how to comment on it?? I reposted my toki pona <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3lbq3dgty722p" target="_blank">Hyde art piece</a> on Bluesky in her honor...<br />
<br />
Thank you all for reading!! I'll probably make another post before Christmas, but if I don't, I hope you all have a wonderful holiday season.<br />
