<br />

<p class="normal" style="font-size:20px">
December 5, 2025 - Published 
</p>

<p class="normal">
Been a bit! I've been busy with multiple things, but a ton of time was put into <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=178621" target="_blank">Debiduba</a>, another game written entirely in Dasopya! This one is an adventure game with puzzle elements, made entirely by me while the music (and some assistance!) is from my good friend SandwichDeer. It was published on the 1st of December to celebrate Dasopya 1.0's one year anniversary.<br />
<br />
The Debiduba are an organization of rescue foxes committed to saving other animals in trouble, and you play as Leni, their newest recruit. The game is meant to be a more dialogue-heavy showcase of Dasopya, and is technically playable without knowing the language, but knowing it (even if just with <a href="https://vecderg.github.io/kutokopo/samukopo.html#pyabyo" target="_blank">the translator</a>) is recommended.<br />
<br />
A bit before the game's release, I published Dasopya <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dasopya.bsky.social/post/3m5hqkcp7gc2e" target="_blank">v1.2.1</a>, which most notably contains 6 new words. To celebrate the anniversary, I posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_lGP7VUFZc" target="_blank">1 video</a> on my main channel going over what's been accomplished, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd7xqs7PVDo" target="_blank">game trailer</a> on the Dasopya channel to announce both games. <br />
<br /> 
Putting this all together took a lot of time, so other than that, I have a lot less to report than usual.<br />
<br />
Art pieces:<br />

- <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3m5fyon474222" target="_blank">SonaPartment #28</a> (<a href="https://itaku.ee/images/1209721" target="_blank">Itaku</a>)<br />
<br />
I'll also mention my article "<a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/languageworld" target="_blank">What ARE all these Languages?</a>" where I explain what the common language options are in things like video game settings (e.g. how Deutsch is actually German, not Dutch). However, it turns out that writing an article on 30+ languages with their history and differences takes a LONG time, so it's unlikely to be finished soon. Enjoy what's on there for now!<br />
<br />

<br />
Wrapping up, I feel like I should do some type of life update, but it's always hard with these posts when they feel simultaneously so public yet so private, since I can't get comments as easily as something like Bluesky. Still, there's a few things I'd like to touch on that I wouldn't consider too personal. <br />
<br />
First is that I have a lot to consider in my relationship with art. There's a lot I love doing (whenever I get a good idea for SonaPartment, I always go FULL send), but other things that I feel I might be driven more by a feeling of obligation than any real passion. <br />
<br />
I still fully intend to follow through on my promises with DracoFighter 2, for example, but at some point I have to admit that the reason I'm not working on it isn't due to my lack of time, and it might be a sign to retire some of my other potential game projects I'm not as passionate about. Meanwhile, the amount of work I've put into Dasopya (despite BARELY having any real audience, by the way) has come naturally because I just enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Which by the way, to be honest, everything about Dasopya still feels really weird. I have a lot of people expecting it to be "done" but the entire project is less than 2 years old, which is actually really short for an auxlang. Depending on the criteria, Dasopya only has like 1-5 speakers, and about 90-95% of its content on the internet has been made solely by me.<br />
<br />
In other words, the language feels so nearly complete, but it's also hilariously young. toki pona only really took off 15-20 years after being published, and that concept is very hard for me to comprehend. It makes sense, of course, but it also makes me think a lot about what it's like for Sonja Lang. Conlanging really is something driven almost solely from passion, and I really wonder if Dasopya will get literally anywhere in the future, or what'll happen once my passion almost inevitably burns out.<br />
<br />
Unrelatedly, it's a really weird time to be a tech-reliant person too, as my Windows 10 computer will no longer be receiving support. Me and my friends are trying our best to switch to Linux, but it's been a surprisingly rough time. I've had great experiences dipping my toes into Linux Mint, but using it as a daily driver is actually pretty difficult. <br />
<br />
Playing Tekken 8 on it (which I've heard Steam games are a very streamlined experience on Linux now) led to surprisingly bad performance, and later freezing my entire computer for much longer than was comfortable. This is before I'm going to be trying more advanced stuff like getting Clip Studio Paint to run on it, and I am simply desperately hoping that I can be free of Windows.<br />
<br />

But, those are just the thoughts I have now. I appreciate everyone who bothers to read my thoughts, and I'll see you next time. polukyu e tay sapye.<br />
