Howdy! Been a bit longer than I wanted, but that just means there's more to show! <br />
<br />
Recently has been pretty weird where it's been difficult to focus on tasks I've wanted to, and I think part of it was just having a massive distracting backlog. So, I really wanted to hack away at it to get myself a clearer head. And I think it helped!<br />
<br />
Starting with my biggest project, <a href="https://youtu.be/ee1biWWYMbs" target="_blank">my Elefen tutorial</a> has finally come out!! I started the script like over a year ago and finally got around to finishing it, which is a huge weight off my back. This is the last planned video in my auxlang series (which doesn't include my own languages), but it's been fun!<br />
<br />
I've considered making a video on Esperanto and/or toki pona, but due to the amount of existing resources, I just don't feel it's worth the large amount of effort since there's already many existing resources out there, and my main goal was the highlight languages that did not yet have a proper video tutorials. There are also currently no other auxlangs that have caught a large enough interest that I want to put the time in for research/recording/video editing, though I do eventually want to make a video on Manmino and have some curiosity about Lidepla.<br />
<br />
I have also written several articles! The titles are:<br />
-  <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/partialaphantasia" target="_blank">Being an Artist with Partial Aphantasia</a> <br />
-  <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/balancefun" target="_blank">Game Balance - Why Balance Means Fun</a> <br />
-  <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/defenseminimalism" target="_blank">In Defense of Minimalism</a> <br />
-  <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/lazyproductive" target="_blank">How Being Lazy Made Me More Productive</a> <br />
<br />
The last thing to show is a commission I finished for my good ol regular Premasaur: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3lazctlfp322s" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> / <a href="https://itaku.ee/images/974868" target="_blank">Itaku</a> <br />
<br />
While I don't imagine this piece to stand out that much compared to some of my other art, it's one of my favorites out of my recent artwork for the pure fact that this is probably what feels the most "my style" to me, which feels very refreshing! Based on what I asked earlier, most people seem to associate me with my SonaPartment style, which is totally fine and cool! But also the "furry in a dynamic pose doing an attack in the air" will always be my genre.<br />
<br />
One more thing to mention that I don't have a ton to show for: I spent like 8 hours straight working on Dasopya the day before yesterday LOL<br />
<br />
I made 50+ changes to the vocbulary to essentially get rid of all my minor gripes, then had to update every existing piece of Dasopya media to match it. It was a lot of work but it'll be super worth it, because (minus the beginning of the language) this is planned to be the biggest update I'll EVER make to Dasopya, past and future -- otherwise, changing all media again will be much more of a pain.<br />
<br />
I wanted to also do this when the vocabulary was nearly finished, so that the last few words could be analyzed more strictly when added, making the process easier. All this work, of course, is for a very specific goal: Dasopya is almost at 1.0!!!<br />
<br />
Version numbers are a funny thing to put on a language, but it's rather common for conlangs, especially since they're marks of stability. Dasopya is a minimalistic language, so once it's done, it's meant to be donezo. While updates are planned for the future, they're likely to be relatively minimal after 1.0, only adding words that are very important and ideally making little to no changes to the existing vocabulary. <br />
<br />
Again, I don't have much to show since I've mainly just been updating existing content (do update your notes if you have any), but I did make a nearly-empty Bluesky account just to take the handle: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dasopya.bsky.social" target="_blank">https://bsky.app/profile/dasopya.bsky.social</a> <br />
<br />
As usual, thank you all lots for reading!!! The next time you get a post from me, hopefully a new language will have officially been born.
