Howdy! I've been preoccupied by various things, but now I've got a lot of stuff to show.<br />
<br />
I had a good bit of energy but wasn't sure how to direct it, before realizing that instead of forcing myself to do things I didn't want to do, I could just fully commit to writing stuff that I did want to. So that's what I did!	<br />
<br />
First is the most major one, another short story about Fidget that features Ube, titled: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kj3b6p1o0qXsMNz0rpbmTk2AvylwJcftfJ6_UgrCmz0/" target="_blank">A Woodworker</a><br />
NOTE -- If you haven't read the past stories, this requires the context of "Rival Incoming," and by extension, "The View Above the Clouds." You can find both here: <a href="../dragonscavern.html">https://vecderg.github.io/dragonscavern.html</a><br />
<br />
I've also written 3 articles on my main website! There are 2 opinion articles: <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/esperanto1" target="_blank">Why I Love Esperanto!</a> and <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/genrepurist" target="_blank">Why I'm a Game Genre Purist (Kinda)</a><br />
<br />
And one analysis of Jack Garland (aka the "I want to kill Chaos" guy) and why 1-dimensional characters can totally be cool: <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/jackgarland" target="_blank">Design Analysis: Jack Garland</a><br />
<br />
I did get a brief bit of art motivation that I hope to carry into the rest of the week! First I made a new beluga mascot for Dasopya which you can now see <a href="https://www.dasopya.com/" target="_blank">on the main website</a>, who I frankly created because I didn't want my robot mascot to become associated with the recent push for AI in conlang communities. I still plan for both of these lil guys to be co-mascots, but just not today. Here they are side by side, so do lemme know what you think!<br />
<br />

<br />
Finally, I did a quick drawing for my recent Webfishing spree. As of the time of writing, I have over 30 hours in the game and bought out every store just today! Of course, this meant I had to draw a meme. It has two versions, both of which are available on Bluesky and Itaku, but I'll just be linking one from each. Here's the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3l7zkqp4t6i27" target="_blank">meme version on Bluesky</a>, and the <a href="https://itaku.ee/images/971640" target="_blank">alt version on Itaku</a>. <br />
<br />
Ironically, this is actually a bit of a milestone because it's the first time I've done a non-painting lineless drawing in forever. Unfortunately, I did not put much effort into it LOL<br />
<br />
Either way, thank you all for the support as always. I always appreciate it when people enjoy the silly things I put out into the internet. And if I do put this post out as planned on Bluesky, then hi new people!! I hope you all enjoy your time on this website.<br />
<br />
Oh! Last note, I added a new RSS icon on the front page which I made from scratch in Inkscape, so I wanted to make it 100% free to use for anyone with or without credit. Here's the raw SVG for your full resolution needs: <a href="../img/rss.svg" target="_blank">https://vecderg.github.io/img/rss.svg</a>
