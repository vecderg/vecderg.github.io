Howdy, y'all. <br />
<br />
It occurred to me that I haven't done a proper overview -anywhere- about all my projects, so for those of you holding your breath on any project of mine, let's go over all of them. <br />
<br />
I did something like this on Cohost way back (can't find the link) but it's about time for a proper update lol <br />
<br />
You can CTRL+F for the subjects: <br />
Netcode Warriors<br />
DracoFighter 2<br />
Dasopya<br />
Other Games<br />
SonaPartment, Writing<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
-- NETCODE WARRIORS --<br />
<br />
For those of you that don't know, Netcode Warriors is a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/netcodewarriors.sonstudios-dev.com" target="_blank">team project</a> I'm on! We had an <a href="https://youtu.be/K-9W732DYFI" target="_blank">announcement trailer</a> a while back, but yes it is still in development. <br />
<br />
I don't think I'm ALLOWED to say anything meaningful about the development (NDA stuff), but as a team project, this has been one of my highest priorities lately, and I'm basically working on-call. <br />
<br />
I feel personally invested in the success of this project for multiple reasons, so despite not being able to say much of anything on the subject, it has been taking a notable amount of my time and energy over other projects which have been more public.<br />
<br />
-- DRACOFIGHTER 2 --<br />
<br />
In 2023 I estimated that it would take 3-4 years to finish the game, which would put the release at 2026-2027. Life happened to throw a lot of very unexpected things at me (some bad, mostly good), and currently I would put the optimistic release date at 2027-2028.<br />
<br />
(Note: I usually say projects take roughly 3x longer than the estimate lol)<br />
<br />
I may have said before that DracoFighter 2 was a "very high priority project" for me, but nowadays it's less "high priority" as in "I will prioritize this over any other project" and more "there is no timeline where I am alive and DracoFighter 2 does not eventually come out in some form."<br />
<br />
Ironically, that actually means that I'm perfectly fine with taking my sweet time with DracoFighter 2. But I still feel bad for being nearly radio-silent about the project other than <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3lmyoa6xs222z" target="_blank">one post</a> that sounded like a pretty lame excuse, so I'll break down everything again at the risk of repeating info from previous posts.<br />
<br />
1) Movesets are 95% complete<br />
<br />
In terms of the actual core gameplay, 95% of the game is essentially complete, which is awesome! I have raw data from the prototype that could be put into a new engine 1:1 and have a perfectly functional fighting game.<br />
<br />
There are some attacks that need to be ironed out or adjusted (most of the 5% is just Cyrus), but these are mainly minor adjustments and most of the time-consuming stuff is out of the way.<br />
<br />
2) Sprites are 90% complete<br />
<br />
Despite my complaining on Twi-- I mean Bluesky, I did a bit more work on sprites to see how I'd do. [DILO] only has about 3 animations left, and Cyrus reuses his old sprites, leaving about 75% of his sprites left to finish.<br />
<br />
For more context on what I said on Bluesky: spriting is MIND-NUMBING. I'm not sure how much I've talked about it before, but despite being well-known for my art, game design IS the main reason I enjoy making games, though spriting takes a massive amount of time.<br />
<br />
DracoFighter 1 only required about half of DF2's sprites (~50 vs ~90), but DF1 BiOS basically took me a month straight of ONLY animating to finish his sprites. People outside game development don't even think about this stuff, but if I go up to anyone who's touched art and tell them "imagine if you had to draw 90 separate drawings to make a single character, now make 8 characters" they'll probably puke.<br />
<br />
Like, I'll do it, and I'd probably be an animator for money, but this is a particular slog worse than DracoFighter 1 specifically because I essentially can't work on anything else. I like switching around different tasks, but right now, it is JUST spriting.<br />
<br />
So, what's the hold-up on the other stuff?<br />
<br />
3) The engine is still incomplete<br />
<br />
If I haven't said it before, BLESS the creator of Sakuga Engine, they are an amazing developer and the engine is basically guaranteed to be the one for DracoFighter 2. However, they are a busy person and DracoFighter 2's engine requires a number of features to be completed in my vision.<br />
<br />
That being said, even if Sakuga Engine was finished literally today, I would still have to spend the time learning the engine, implementing all the sprites and frame data and mechanics, playtesting, etc., and that all takes time!<br />
<br />
4) The everything else<br />
<br />
Now, once we finish ALL of the above, we have some fun fun stuff ahead of us. I plan to contract some friends for assets like music and 3D models, I still have to finish writing story and dialogue, design and implement new game modes, and put in the dreary work for putting the game up on storefronts and getting translations.<br />
<br />
Relative to all the other work... I DON'T actually expect this to take as much time LOL and that's only because spriting is a beast.<br />
<br />
However, that's also at least a year's work, and since I'd like to have extra characters just like DF1 (probably post-launch), there will be a lot of work ahead of me.<br />
<br />
This is why I'm not eager to rush anything lol<br />
<br />
-- DASOPYA --<br />
<br />
Dasopya's been eating good, but slowed down recently. I'm still kind of waiting for interested parties to volunteer to do more stuff, but I think the language just needs more traction which I cannot offer right now.<br />
<br />
Either way, I've been putting in WORK -- we have 795 root words, 336 recorded compounds, 129 loans, a video tutorial, multiple translations, multiple written tutorials (including one available in 7 languages), a instant searchable dictionary, and even a translation aide!<br />
<br />
However, with mentions in a few places, I'll say it explicitly here: at this point, I want to focus on Dasopya as strictly being a hobbyist for-fun project where I don't feel pressured to make a world language or whatever. If I had the energy, I would put in the effort to actually rebrand the project as part artlang and part auxlang, since my goal is just to have fun with it and have other people have fun with it.<br />
<br />
I wrote a more detailed list on the Discord, but to summarize: I do plan to 1) continue updating the wiki, 2) make a text-heavy Pico-8 / Picotron game, and 3) make more oHayde i pya videos, while being more biased against working on projects like translations, new tutorials/learning material, etc.<br />
<br />
These projects are not high priority and will only really be in my free time. However, unlike a lot of my other projects, they actually tend to -decrease- my stress, so I may seem to prioritize it more often than I really "should".<br />
<br />
-- THE OTHER GAMES --<br />
<br />
I've shown off a lot of game ideas over the years, either by prototype or by mention. Demon's Heir, Otto the Otter, Serpent's Tale, etc. There's even ideas that only a few of my friends know about! However, between all the projects above, I really do have my work cut out for me. It would not be unrealistic to say that you might have to wait nearly an entire decade before seeing ANY of these.<br />
<br />
This isn't uncommon for game developers, big or small, so I'm sorry to say that there's a high chance most of these get cancelled. However, mentioning these does help! One of my friends mentioned a game idea I had forgotten about, and it's reignited my interest in continuing it.<br />
<br />
<b>If there is a game idea that has a considerable amount of demand, it might actually encourage me to work on it,</b> even though I generally don't like being pressured into doing certain things.<br />
<br />
But in terms of what's realistic? Here's my list of games that could conceivably get development/news within the next 5 years (note: these priorities change ALL the time and this list could be completely scrambled in a month):<br />
<br />
[Dasopya Game] - smaller game, high chance to be my next release<br />
[Kiru's Game] - VERY excited to tell this story<br />
toki soweli (name pending) - funny language game<br />
Exodus (name pending) - the one my friend mentioned<br />
<br />
Probably abandoned: Li'l Hatchling, Dragon Pet 2, Demon's Heir (kinda lost the big reasons I was interested, but don't worry -- Beewee's story will still be told in one way or another)<br />
<br />
50/50: DragoRescue 2, null, Dog Eat Dog, Serpent's Tail, The Mailman, Otto the Otter (it's just... a basic 2D platformer)
<br />
<br />
-- SONAPARTMENT, WRITING, ETC. --<br />
<br />
If you're holding your breath for the next SonaPartment comic, written article, Youtube video, or even canon Fidget story content, I wouldn't recommend it lol<br />
<br />
These are things I'm only really working on whenever I feel like it. I do have an idea for the next SonaPartment arc, but it's a good bit of work to comic and pretty low priority next to everything else, so I doubt it's happening anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I am throwing out articles randomly which are mentioned here, but I haven't felt very inspired on ideas lately -- most of the stuff I REALLY wanted to write, I've written already, I think. Fidget's story will... continue one day lol<br />
<br />
-- CONCLUSION --<br />
<br />
I thiiiink that's about it for now. There are things I've done since the last post on here, but I'll wait to announce those in the next post since this one's already a big update lol<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for reading and for following my projects! I look forward to the next time I get to do a big infodump.<br />
<br />
