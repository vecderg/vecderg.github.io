Hello again!<br />
<br />
After a bit of a break, I've finally gotten the ball rolling again and made a lot of great progress. Maybe I can keep it going, maybe it'll stop soon, but either way there's some big stuff to mention.<br />
<br />
First of all, Dasopya finally has a <a href="https://youtu.be/DbpzzWu761Q" target="_blank">Youtube tutorial</a>! This has been planned for a long while, but was only able to be created now that the language has reached a stable spot. If you wanted to get into the language but have been intimidated by all the documents, please give it a look!<br />
<br />
Accompanying this guide is <a href="https://youtu.be/l8v2-3-j3eQ" target="_blank">the first video</a> for the official Dasopya Youtube channel! It's a quick thing I put together so the channel has something in it, but it's my hope that I can make more immersion-style videos to help the language going. <br />
<br />
I've also been working on <a href="https://vecderg.github.io/kutokopo/sadilusi.html" target="_blank">this introduction to Dasopya</a>, which will be translated to as many languages as I can. It's currently available in English, Esperanto, and toki pona! Dasopya's development will be much slower now as it increases in stability, so that means we get to have a much larger focus on creating Dasopya media.<br />
<br />
Also, good news for DracoFighter fans! I posted a new video showing off some basic gameplay of 2 of the new DracoFighter 2 characters: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecdev.bsky.social/post/3lfvn6lxf3k2v" target="_blank">https://bsky.app/profile/vecdev.bsky.social/post/3lfvn6lxf3k2v</a><br />
<br />
I'm still working within the DracoFighter 1 engine, but the news of the new engine has brought me enough energy to continue spriting. [DILO] now has 7 new animations (22 sprites in total) with about 9 animations left to finish.<br />
<br />
I wrote a few language-related articles that will be hosted here, exclusively:<br />
- <a href="https://vecderg.github.io/articles/article3.html" target="_blank">Why Words are Fake</a><br />
- <a href="https://vecderg.github.io/articles/article4.html" target="_blank">English is not an Easy Language</a><br />
<br /> 
I also had a funny <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3lfiyzyiruk2u" target="_blank">art-adjacent post</a> blow up on Bluesky recently and hit 500 likes, so that happened. Not the first time I've had a PMD post blow up, nor a piece I threw together on Paint.NET...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I did want to give some apologies to the people following me for art. I'm not really the type to apologize for stuff like that (I think both me and my audience understand that I'm the type of person that just posts whatever I feel like), but it's been almost 2 months since my last real art post of something new, so I still feel obliged to.<br />
<br />
I'm partly out of my weird art block phase, but I've still been struggling a lot with rediscovering what it is that I enjoy about art, so it's something that I'll have to continue processing later when I'm not in the middle of so many things. Since this is currently the only site that I don't feel a million eyes on me, I may talk about it more in a future post.<br />
<br />
For now, there is still a lot that I very much enjoy! And again, a huge thank you to everyone for your support.<br />
<br />
