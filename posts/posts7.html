Lots of news! Despite the title, I actually want to first note the changes on my website. 
<br />
<br />
I've already expressed some concern about my website having a glitch where it becomes unclickable, so I've removed every JS script from the front page other than the webrings, since those are kind of important for me to have. 
<br />
<br />
As the front page now says, please let me know if there are any other issues (even though I'll be rather unsure how to proceed if they continue). I only knew that it was still broken because someone messaged me on <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/feedback-and-comments" target="_blank">my main website's comment system</a>, so you can use that if you can't reach me elsewhere.
<br />
<br />
Second, HUGE progress on Dasopya!! We've finally hit 750 words, and I finished my biggest translation so far, which is The Tale of Peter Rabbit:
<a href="https://www.dasopya.com/readings/the-tale-of-peter-rabbit" target="_blank">https://www.dasopya.com/readings/the-tale-of-peter-rabbit</a>
<br />
<br />
This is a story very near and dear to my heart, so I was very happy to finish it, though it took me about a whole week straight. I also finished <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/133gbKFGP3ubczpCkUwKM1cA8Kj3VNGmERQVTF_g7UJE/" target="_blank">the Dasopya cheat sheet</a>, which has a quick but rather thorough introduction to the language on a single page, with about 150 words on the back. 
<br />
<br />
We also have our first audio resource for Dasopya, though it's just a short recording on <a href="https://www.dasopya.com/overview" target="_blank">the language overview page</a>. Google Sites doesn't play well with embedded audio, so I'll have to consider either changing websites or using some other workaround like putting them on Youtube instead.
<br />
<br />
There are 2 important art pieces of note that I made since the last update, the first is a commission for my good friend Eijin, which is on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3l6gxrhhlhc2q" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://itaku.ee/images/951983" target="_blank">Itaku</a>. The other is SonaPartment #25, which is on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3l6qnz6k2x72j" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/vecderg/art/SonaPartment-25-1111386836" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a>. I'll upload the SonaPartment stuff on Itaku some day, when I'm in the mood to go through the pain of finding and tagging 25 separate comics...
<br />
<br />
Lastly, this is a minor note, but I'm now hosting my old Twitter thread of art tutorials on my website: <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/arttutorials" target="_blank">https://www.vecderg.com/arttutorials</a>
<br />
<br />
This is a list I had for my mouse art tutorial, which I've STILL gotten messages about over the years, so it was important for me to have a stable place for everything to be in. Even if you haven't watched that video, it should be a helpful list of tutorials for anyone to get into art.
<br />
<br />
I know that's a lot, but I really wanted to wait until I was finished with my Peter Rabbit translation before posting this, so do take a peek if you can! I know not many people are interested in learning Dasopya, but Peter Rabbit and its author Beatrix Potter have some absolutely FASCINATING lore (did you know Peter Rabbit was the first licensed character ever?). Just... ignore all the live-action movie stuff.
