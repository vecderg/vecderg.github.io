Hello again! I didn't think it's been that long since the last post, but I looked at the date and it's almost been a month actually, and there is a lot to report! <br />
<br />
First is that I've officially left the studio working on Netcode Warriors. This was for personal reasons and has nothing to do with the studio or the people there -- please follow and support them as much as you can! They're doing a lot of amazing stuff, and I want that to be recognized. <br />
<br />
The studio (Son Studios) is actually working on 2 projects right now, one being Netcode Warriors which you can wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2823570/Netcode_Warriors/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and the other is a fighting game for Saturday AM which was announced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH2bKl2e3WY" target="_blank">here</a>, and you can follow their news on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/saturdayam.bsky.social" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>. I will most likely not be reporting on their news in these posts myself since I'm no longer on the projects. <br />
<br /> 
Second piece of news, I've officially left DeviantArt. I had mentioned it in my last post, but it's been made official with <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/vecderg/art/Goodbye-DeviantArt-1245736161" target="_blank">my announcement</a> (featuring cute Fidget art!).<br />
<br /> 
The reason it was delayed was to make time so I could reupload every SonaPartment comic offsite, which you can find <a href="https://itaku.ee/profile/vecderg/gallery/55615" target="_blank">here</a> on Itaku. This is currently the ONLY upload of all the SonaPartment comics that also has proper tags and alt text! This should also allow me to easily reupload to other places too if necessary.<br />
<br />
Now, let's get to the good stuff! I have posted a few videos, but want to highlight one in particular. The Cursed Conlang Circus is a competition held every year to see who can make the most cursed conlang, and I wanted to participate for CCC4! My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nR8pJcBeJk" target="_blank">submission</a> was a language you can speak entirely without opening your mouth, called hm’hnn. It's pretty bad and rushed but also took way longer than expected, so your support is very much appreciated!!<br />
<br />
My other 2 videos:<br />
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loru0BRkxbA" target="_blank">The best art program NOBODY talks about</a> - Video going over Pureref<br />
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4xrqFSI22Q" target="_blank">You should use an RSS Feed in 2025!</a> - Video going over RSS<br />
<br />
And now for my articles:<br />
- <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/languagelearning" target="_blank">How to Learn a Language</a> - Article I wrote in April that's been edited and published! <br />
- <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/auxlangs" target="_blank">The Search for the Perfect Auxlang</a> - A COMPLETE rewrite of my original auxlang article with new content! First version linked inside.<br />
<br />
I also did a quick fun <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social/post/3lzsb2x3jrc2v" target="_blank">sketch</a> for my good friend TexanSoda.<br />
<br />

Thank you all for reading and thanks again for all the support! sesey sopi a bay i dyu loy e polukyu!<br />
