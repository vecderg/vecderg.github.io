<p class="normal">
With Cohost going down, it is essentially the second time I have to move my digital home elsewhere.
This event is rather big for me, not due to the event alone (which is big, but the website only
existed for about 2 years and was never colossal), but due to what it signifies for me as someone
whose home is on the internet.
<br />
<br />
I'm learning how RSS feeds work so this website can be somewhere I connect with more people,
because it is now one of the few places I can properly express myself. I've written
<a href="../articles/article1.html">my first article</a> on this website to fully vent out 
my feelings on the situation, so note that it'll be more negative and dramatic than my usual
content.
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the most notable updates are that 1) I'll be more active on BlueSky, where I created
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecdev.bsky.social" target="_blank">a new dev account</a> 
(Vecdev) for anyone only interested in my gamedev endeavors. Of course, you can still
find me on Bluesky under <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vecderg.bsky.social" target="_blank">Vecderg</a> 
for my general content.
<br />
<br />
2) I've been making great progress on my conlang, <a href="https://www.dasopya.com/" target="_blank">Dasopya</a>!
I briefly announced this on Cohost, but it's a language made for international communication where
every word is made from scratch (a priori). I will be continuing to promote and update on it, so 
expect that in the future -- it currently has over 700 words!
<br />
<br />
The main website is fully laid out to introduce the language, but more interestingly, I also have a 
converter + font for the alternate writing system! You can find both at this itch page:
<a href="https://vecderg.itch.io/pyalibu" target="_blank">https://vecderg.itch.io/pyalibu</a>
<br />
<br />
As always, thank you all for the support.
