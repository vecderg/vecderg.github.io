It's been a bit!<br />
<br />
Reading the previous entry is kind of funny, because the ball stopped rolling almost immediately after posting it. The reason? Well, to put it simply... I moved! I don't like talking too much about my personal life in public posts, but I will say that it's taken up a lot of my time, and anyone who knows me personally can ask for more details.<br />
<br />
Still, that hasn't stopped me from having a lot more to update on! I enjoy doing projects during my free time...<br />
<br />
My most major announcement is the release of my PICO-8 game <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=147601" target="_blank">Konakin</a>! It's a 5-15 min open world Frogger adventure featuring text exclusively in my auxlang Dasopya, but is 100% playable without knowledge of the language. <br />
<br />
Despite primarily being made for Dasopya, this was an idea I've had for a while, and the first "real" PICO-8 game I've made since <a href="https://vecderg.github.io/p8games/pond.html" target="_blank">the other one</a> essentially feels like a prototype. Even though many things can be difficult in it, I love using PICO-8 and being able to just release tiny games that work perfectly on websites for both mobile and desktop. People don't understand how magical that is! It's also mentioned on the site, but many thanks to my friend SandwichDeer for helping out -- he composed the title theme!<br />
<br />
Speaking of Dasopya, I also had a friend help out in translating <a href="https://vecderg.github.io/kutokopo/sadilusi.html#espanol" target="_blank">the language's introduction</a> to Spanish -- many thanks to Snow! I am still looking for translators for other languages, if anyone is willing.<br />
<br />
I also released <a href="https://youtu.be/WZxj1mHFCpA" target="_blank">a Youtube video</a>! It's a discussion on Smash Bros' (and general platform fighters') design analyzed as a fighting game, which is a subject I have surprisingly not seen on Youtube. It's unscripted and a bit unorganized, but I would love to do more videos like this if people enjoy (and they seemed to very much!).<br />
<br />
I finished writing several articles:<br />
- <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/targetaudience" target="_blank">How Target Audiences Work</a> - introduction mainly for gamedevs<br />
- <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/balancetop" target="_blank">Why are Games Balanced Around Top Level Play?</a><br />
- <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/motioninputs" target="_blank">Practical Use Cases for Motion Inputs</a><br />
- <a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/englishfacts" target="_blank">5 English Facts you (Probably) Didn't Know</a><br />
- <a href="https://vecderg.github.io/articles/article5.html" target="_blank">Cool (Natural) Languages I Like</a><br />

<br /> 
Aaaaand that's about it! Thank you all for reading, and if you still follow this RSS feed... I appreciate you!!!<br />
