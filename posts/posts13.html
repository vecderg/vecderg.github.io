Happy new year!<br />
<br />
(This post will probably get a bit rambley, but for those skimming, this post will have <i><b>semi-major news for DracoFighter 2 and Dasopya</b></i>, even if neither have things that are particularly finished yet!) <br />
<br />
I've spent a good amount of time trying to absorb some of the events of this year, and I think it'll still take a long time before I remotely do.<br />
<br />
While filing away a backup of my art for the year, I remarked to a friend, "Wow, there's a lot less this year," and he told me, "Yeah, because you've spent most of your time on those sprites, right?" and then I had to go, "Oh yeah, those sprites." <br />
<br />
I was so deep into my side project of making an entirely new language that I completely forgot I had been spent the first ~9 months of that year making sprites for a game that didn't exist yet..... which I suppose is not something everyone can say?? <br />
<br />
-- DRACOFIGHTER 2 UPDATES -- 
<br />
<br />
I'll get right into DracoFighter 2 first. Being the new year and all, I want to be a little self-congratulatory for a bit, because I feel like I deserve it. This year was the first year I completed all the sprites for a single character, being Draco with 90 sprites (including the reused ones)!<br />
<br />
Afterwards, I finished all the sprites for: Plexie, BiOS, [STEGO], [TREX], and [RAPTOR]! I completed a notable number of sprites for [DILO], and Cyrus still has many reusable sprites. This is a huge amount of work!!! Every completed character has roughly 80-100 sprites, so accounting for sprites already completed, I drew roughly 350+ sprites this year! That's like a drawing a day!! That's crazy to me!! <br />
<br />
For reference, every DF1 character had about 50 sprites each, meaning that in this single year I drew more completed sprites than the entirety of DF1. I'll probably be able to do a more accurate count sometime when I have the DF2 project set up, since right now everything's in folders which makes it very difficult to count. With that being said...<br />
<br />
WE HAVE AN ENGINE!!! It's not completed yet, but I'm unbelievably happy that an actual real engine exists now that fits every criteria I need. It's free, it's open source, and it already has completely functional rollback!! Even if this isn't the engine I end up going with, there's a lot of relief in just seeing this exist, and there's a high likelihood it gets finished: <a href="https://github.com/NoisyChain/Sakuga-Engine" target="_blank">https://github.com/NoisyChain/Sakuga-Engine</a> <br />
<br />
I already tested putting Draco in with basic functionality, and it's very well-made! There's a lot of eyes on it, so I hope it goes well. I only talked about it in an update a while ago, but man the whole engine issue has really been bothering me more than I realized...<br />
<br />
Plans for DracoFighter 2 haven't changed much. The engine still isn't finished, so I'll continue to sprite when I can, though I'm still suffering from some artblock most likely caused by all the spriting. After I finish both Cyrus and [DILO], we'll most likely be looking at engine implementation if it's finished (or nearly finished), or more assets if it's not (VFX, UI, story text, etc.).<br />
<br />
-- DASOPYA UPDATES -- <br />
<br />
Dasopya really did kind of come out of nowhere, and I probably wouldn't believe you if you told me at the beginning of the year that making a new international auxiliary language would be my 6+ month project of the year. Well, actually, I probably would believe you, but would be rather annoyed LOL <br />
<br />
As I update the project more, my own personal enjoyment of it increases as well. I have a mini update being dubbed v1.1.1 (yes, Minecraft style) that adjusts a handful of words while adding about a dozen new ones. You can read the changes listed on the spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c64g6Yftybzoe9KeHm_WyeTTtMec23YiMDap351RxFw/edit?gid=1731217827#gid=1731217827&range=A278" target="_blank">here</a>. They're not final yet, and will be given about a week before they're solidified and reflected in existing learning/story material outside the spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
Dasopya has a handful of other very notable announcements. We're setting up our wiki on Miraheze instead of Fandom, because Fandom, and you can find the new wiki <a href="https://dasopya.miraheze.org/" target="_blank">here</a>. It's still rather bare-bones, but it's ready to be populated with articles.<br />
<br />
We also now have a <a href="https://vecderg.github.io/kutokopo/samukopo.html" target="_blank">searchable dictionary</a>!! No more spreadsheet scrolling and Ctrl+F, just use a search bar! This will also include the new v1.1.1 words when the update is solidified. It's a little rough around the edges since it's pure HTML/JS I made by myself, but it was a very fun challenge since I haven't done many similar projects at all.<br />
<br />
The Dasopya Discord also created <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dasopya.bsky.social/post/3lefyr24ork2j" target="_blank">their own script</a>, bukudoli! This was mainly the work of Goji (@gojiberry.cc on Bsky), so huge thank you to them. <br />
<br />
I get a good amount of feedback in the Discord, but the existing script (pyalibu) got WAY more unanimous criticism than I ever expected, so I wasn't unhappy turning the challenge over to the members. It seems like I have a lot to learn about writing scripts, something I didn't realize would have so many unintended issues.
<br />
<br />
The last real note for Dasopya is that I spent December joining the Lexember hashtag, and posted a Dasopya word (almost) every day! I had only just found out about it at the beginning of December, so this was also a fun little project. You can find it <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dasopya.bsky.social/post/3lene5csxak2l" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
<br />
I'm very very happy with Dasopy's progress over the year, and only hope to continue to give it a bigger and brighter future! <br />
<br />
-- OTHER UPDATES + REFLECTION -- <br />

<br />
Looking back on the year... is really weird. It feels more like a transitional period for me than anything. A lot of really big, important things happened to me, but none of them have LED anywhere yet. I might have 600+ DracoFighter 2 sprites sitting on my computer right now, but nowhere to put them. I might have a completed language, but nowhere to use it. I'm very happy and proud of the work I did, but I have a strong feeling that 2025 is where the really big things are going to happen. Which is kinda exciting and intimidating!<br />
<br />
This was the year I completed my conlang tutorial series. This was the year I went to Europe for the first time! This was the year I became active on Bluesky. This was the year I said goodbye to Cohost.<br />
<br />
This was the year I started posts on this website! This was the year I learned how to use RSS. This was the year I made most of the DF2 sprites, and made Dasopya, and quit Tumblr, and made a Neocities account, and met many wonderful people I'm now able to call my friends. That's a lot, isn't it...<br />
<br />
Oh, I almost forgot. I had a yearly tradition on Twitter where I would post about my yearly goals, after catching up on last year's. Since Twitter isn't a good archive anymore, I'll post about the past years here, too.<br />
<br />
"2023 hobbyist goals:<br />
- get a proper prototype for dracofighter 2! <br />
- release a small side game <br />
- get to a conversational level in at least 1 language <br />
- make a pico8 app" <br />
<br />
On technicalities, I've essentially done all of these! I released <a href="https://vecderg.github.io/htmlgames.html">Pond's Training</a>, a small PICO-8 game. I didn't complete a full prototype for DracoFighter 2, but the gameplay is fleshed out on the DF1 engine, and I tested the new one. Finalmente, puedo hablar español, pero no estoy muy bueno...<br />
<br />
I'm unsure what my 2024 goals will be, but I can go with:<br />
- release a small game with Dasopya <br />
- finish all the base DF2 cast sprites <br />
- find a new hobby <br />
<br />
Aiming kind of low here because I have a lot of IRL goals that I won't be disclosing here... but I'll note some unofficial goals 1) making music which has been on the backlog, 2) making a PICO-8 / Picotron game because I just love those things, and 3) possibly learning a new game engine just because.<br />
<br />
Either way, very happy with the progress for my goals, since even if they're based on technicalities, I usually don't expect to hit all my goals at once lol<br />
<br />
-- YEARLY GOAL ARCHIVE -- <br />
<br />
Thank you all lots for reading!! I'll dedicate the rest of the post just to archiving my old yearly goals, but I hope you all have a wonderful new year's.<br />
<br />
"2019 goals (which i will look back on and laugh at in a year): <br />
- learn lineart <br />
- proper art studies <br /> 
- learn 3d animation <br />
- do 2d animation  <br />
- make a game <br />
- find direction for my youtube channel  <br />
- reach 1k subs <br />
- make everyone furries <br />
- become all-powerful <br />
- gain world domination" <br />
<br />
"ok but more realistically <br />
- make a 1+ min 2d animation <br />
- finish a rigged 3d model and animate it <br />
- finish a game, even a small one <br />
- gain world domination <br />
<br />
i should be able to do that in a year, right?" <br />
<br />
2020 reflection: "forgot i made this and actually ig i did a few of these" <br />
<br />
2022 goals: "past me was a scrub and didnt make any more yearly goals so here's 2022 goals: <br />
- publish dracofighter <br />
- get a game out with networking <br />
- finish a realism drawing <br />
- finish a 1min+ animation <br />
- 3d work!! (game? animation? model)" <br />
<br />
2023 reflection: <br />
"v happy with this year, has been p wild! but i feel that i made a lot of progress personally and professionally 😊  <br />
<br />
i can comfortably say i finished half of these (DF, realism painting, 3d model) which is honestly more than i expected" <br />
<br />
2023 goals: "prob gonna keep this year's hobbyist goals more tame while i focus more on professional goals: <br />
- make 3d game prototype with animated models <br />
- make a 2d animation (this goal is like 3 years running LOL) <br />
- use less TWITTER <br />
<br />
will also unofficially include learning pico8 and composing some music as goals (maybe even learning piano!), but i don't really want them to be focuses <br />
<br />
im also already learning pico8 at this moment anyway so hmm hmmMM" <br />
<br />
2024 reflection (now on Vecdevg): <br />
"i feel obliged to continue this tradition lol<br />
<br />
kept my goals low for this year but it's still surprising to me that i kind of met all of them (3d prototype demon's heir, 2d animation dracofighter 2 sprites on technicality, and definitely using less twitter LOL) <br />
<br />
achievements for this year were unexpected, but i'm v happy with what i pulled together<br />
<br />
with that being said, yes! i should have a lot more time for dracofighter 2 next year<br />
<br />
there's still a lot of work to do..."<br />
