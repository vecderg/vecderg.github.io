<p class="normal">
Conlangs are constructed languages, languages that were created and designed intentionally rather than naturally. 
This has become a big interest of mine! I'm mainly interested in auxlangs (languages designed to be an international auxiliary language, like English but better), and I find their design process very fascinating, especially since they're the type of art that can never be perfected.<br>
<br>
<b>Dasopya</b> is my current project, so please check it out!<br>
It's made to be my ideal auxlang, with ~800 root words, enough to be expressive but low enough to be reasonably memorized. It's a priori and oligosynthetic, with grammar inspired by well-received existing conlangs, including Globasa and Mini-Linga. Every root word is 2 syllables or less. You can read more on the official website: <br>

I've written multiple articles on conlangs:

Along with some Youtube videos! <br>

<br>
<br>
And here's the other conlangs I've created:
<br>
<br>

<b>Kaliwe</b> was my first conlang, and it has only 50 words! <br>
It's minimalistic and initially designed as an auxlang, but now exists mainly to be Ube's language
(he's the lil guy attached to your cursor right now, if you're on desktop): <br>

- For local HTML version of documentation: <a href="conlangs/kaliwe.html" target="_blank">(link)</a> <br>
<br>
<b>Babol</b> is an artlang I've been working on every now and then. <br>
The sole goal is to just make a language that's fun for me to speak, specifically, while still being fully functional: <br>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mOI9F5-AedKeueRpMIxFKBmmzecXwPiVepu0awyrwjc/edit" target="_blank">[google drive link]</a><br>
<br>
<b>Taynmoga</b> is an auxlang where every root word is 1 syllable, with 450 words in total. <br>
Essentially an attempt to recreate Kaliwe's concept with more usability by taking pieces of existing
auxlangs, I've stopped supporting Taynmoga since it's been reworked into Dasopya. However, it is a complete project: <br>

- And for the vocabulary: <a href="conlangs/taynmogavocab.html" target="_blank">(link)</a><br>
<br>
<b>Enlix</b> (pronounced "en-leesh") is an auxlang that I'm considering abandoned. <br>
It's an attempt to simplify English by taking advantage of the fact that it's so well-known, and turning the
phonology into something that's easier to pronounce for foreigners + making rules much more consistent. The
result is something that sounds pretty ugly and extremely cursed, but if anyone wants to pick it up and
turn it into something better, please feel free to! <br>
