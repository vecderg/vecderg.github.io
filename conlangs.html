<br>

<p class="normal">
Conlangs are constructed languages, languages that were created and designed intentionally rather than naturally. 
This has become a big interest of mine! There's something so cool to me about how languages can be designed --
especially with auxlangs (languages designed to be an international auxiliary language), there are a lot of pros
and cons to different design elements.<br>
<br>
I've written multiple articles on conlangs:
<br> 
<br>
"The Search for the Perfect Auxlang" (my thoughts on different auxlangs):<br>
<a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/auxlangs" target="_blank">https://www.vecderg.com/articles/auxlangs</a><br> 
<br>
"Why There Can't be a Perfect Auxlang" (my thoughts on general auxlang design): <br> 
<a href="https://www.vecderg.com/articles/auxlangs2" target="_blank">https://www.vecderg.com/articles/auxlangs2</a><br>
<br>
"Thoughts on Auxlang Marketing": <br>

Other conlang content (e.g. resources I created for Mini-Linga): <br>

<br>
I've made a few conlangs too!
<br>
<br>
<b>Kaliwe</b> is my only complete conlang, and it has only 50 words! <br>
It's minimalistic and initially designed as an auxlang, but now exists mainly to be Ube's language
(he's the lil guy attached to your cursor right now, if you're on desktop): <br>

<br>
<b>Babol</b> is an artlang I'm currently working on. <br>
The sole goal is to just make a language that's fun for me to speak, specifically, while still being fully functional: <br>

<br>
<b>Enlix</b> (pronounced "en-leesh") is an auxlang that I'm considering abandoned. <br>
It's an attempt to simplify English by taking advantage of the fact that it's so well-known, and turning the
phonology into something that's easier to pronounce for foreigners + making rules much more consistent. The
result is something that sounds pretty ugly and extremely cursed, but if anyone wants to pick it up and
turn it into something better, please feel free to! <br>
