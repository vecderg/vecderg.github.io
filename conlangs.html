<br>

<p class="normal">
Conlangs are constructed languages, languages that were created and designed intentionally rather than naturally. 
This has become a big interest of mine! There's something so cool to me about how languages can be designed --
especially with auxlangs (languages designed to be an international auxiliary language, like English but better), 
there are a lot of pros and cons to different design elements.<br>
<br>
I've written multiple articles on conlangs:
<br> 
<br>
"The Search for the Perfect Auxlang" (my thoughts on different auxlangs):<br>

"Why There Can't be a Perfect Auxlang" (my thoughts on general auxlang design): <br>

<br>
I've made a number of conlangs too!
<br>
<br>
<b>Dasopya</b> is made to be my ideal auxlang, and is my current project! <br>
It has 700+ words, enough to be expressive but low enough to be reasonably memorized. It's a priori
and oligosynthetic, with grammar inspired by existing well-received conlangs, including Globasa and 
Mini-Linga. Every root word is 2 syllables or less. You can read more here: <br>
<a href="https://www.dasopya.com/" target="_blank">https://www.dasopya.com/</a><br>
<br>
<b>Kaliwe</b> was my first conlang, and it has only 50 words! <br>
It's minimalistic and initially designed as an auxlang, but now exists mainly to be Ube's language
(he's the lil guy attached to your cursor right now, if you're on desktop): <br>

- For local HTML version of documentation: <a href="conlangs/kaliwe.html" target="_blank">(link)</a> <br>
<br>
<b>Babol</b> is an artlang I've been working on every now and then. <br>
The sole goal is to just make a language that's fun for me to speak, specifically, while still being fully functional: <br>

<br>
<b>Taynmoga</b> is an auxlang where every root word is 1 syllable, with 450 words in total. <br>
Essentially an attempt to recreate Kaliwe's concept with more usability by taking pieces of existing
auxlangs, I've stopped supporting Taynmoga since it's been reworked into Dasopya. However, it is a complete project: <br>

- And for the vocabulary: <a href="conlangs/taynmogavocab.html" target="_blank">(link)</a><br>
<br>
<b>Enlix</b> (pronounced "en-leesh") is an auxlang that I'm considering abandoned. <br>
It's an attempt to simplify English by taking advantage of the fact that it's so well-known, and turning the
phonology into something that's easier to pronounce for foreigners + making rules much more consistent. The
result is something that sounds pretty ugly and extremely cursed, but if anyone wants to pick it up and
turn it into something better, please feel free to! <br>
