<p class="normal doubleborder" style="text-align:center;margin:auto";>DEMON'S HEIR</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">
A world full of ancient magic artifacts, and the eternal greed for power...<br>
<br>
Over the ages, many evils have risen and fallen. While the rare hero will rise up to defeat
them, there are some that think true heroism has never been possible.<br>
<br>
The Demon's Heir Universe, not officially named, is planned to be a non-linear video game
series. A "demake" of <a href="https://vecderg.itch.io/demons-heir" target="_blank">Demon's Heir</a> has been created, and <a href="https://vecderg.itch.io/demons-heir-3d" target="_blank">a prototype</a> of the 3D version.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Beewee - A ninja cat who seems to enjoy slaying his enemies a little too much. His skills with 
his katana and kunai are unparalleled, and it's clear he will not be satisfied until he succeeds
against the most powerful opponents in battle.<br>
<br>
Tusk - An ancient evil sealed away by heroes long ago. Legends speak of him as being a demon
who slayed masses of innocents and heroes alike, for nothing other than the thrill of death, 
using the power of their souls to fuel his power. Only someone insane would free him.<br>
<br>
Kiru - Assassin who took contracts to keep himself fed on the streets. After his employer 
betrayed him to obtain a magical artifact for himself, Kiru swears revenge on his
organization and to dismantle the hierarchy of power.<br>
<br>
Ta'Diin - An imp sealed away in a set of daggers, with powers to teleport anywhere instantly. 
Despite his mischievous nature, his banishment has actually caused him to be incredibly jaded
and uncaring.<br>
