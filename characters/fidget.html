<p class="normal">
Fidget Habanogard is a young red panda-dragon who's born to a legendary hero. He wants to follow 
in his footsteps, but realizes that it may be more difficult than expected...<br>
<br>
...
<br><br>
In the non-canon SonaPartment AU, Fidget is silly and unadapted to city life. He gets along with
everyone, but without others to keep a leash on him, he would be the source of much more chaos.<br>
<br>
...
<br><br>
Fidget is my baby boy, and my first sona! While he had multiple versions, I generally consider him
to have been created on 2016's Christmas Eve. I had many considerations for what my sona would be;
with many favorite species, I ended up deciding on a red-panda dragon hybrid who became anthro.<br>
<br>
While some of his personality would be inherited from my own, I ironically ended up growing into 
his personality more than anything, especially since he was given features that I admired.<br>
<br>
He's brash, earnest, outgoing, and incredibly talented at pure magic output. However, he seriously
lacks any real social skills and has no understanding of the real world's complex inner workings.<br>
<br>
I've been very interested in writing his story for a long time -- going out into the real world to
discover who you want to grow up to be, while subverting tropes and making Fidget face that issue
while legendary heroes aren't really needed in that world.<br>
<br>
Before I began canon content for him, however, Fidget largely acted as my personal stand-in and got 
involved in a lot of memes, so his SonaPartment version, while being the same character, pushes
that part of his personality a lot more, complete with the running jokes.<br>
<br>
So, as usual, I'll be trying to write an emotional and complex story while also trying to insert a 
way for Fidget to eat actual rocks...
