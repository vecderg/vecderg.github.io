I'm not really the type of person to tell people to spend money. I will usually give them the most cost-effective solution to their issue first, and even if I recommend something like a game, it will usually be because it's both on sale and something I can guarantee will be a good experience.<br /> 
<br /> 
This may be one of those times, but it's mostly because I have heard so many bad rice takes that I am on my knees begging for you all. <b>Please, just buy a FLIPPIN' rice cooker.</b> <br />
<br />
A cheap rice cooker goes for a total of $20, sometimes less. It will be able to take about 3 cups of uncooked rice, which is enough to feed a single person for two whole days. The rice will take less than an hour to cook. The rice cooker will last for several years.<br />
<br />
People tell me cooking rice is hard because they try cooking it on a stove. Most people who cook rice regularly do not cook it on a stove. You press one button on a $20 device and it cooks it perfectly every time in less than an hour.<br />
<br />
"But I don't want more applicances that just take up space!" It takes up the space of a singular average pot.<br />
<br />
"But I don't want a device that only cooks one thing!" Search up rice cooker recipes. You basically bought a $20 instant pot.<br />
<br />
Obviously, not everyone needs a rice cooker, but I KNOW the people complaining about the exact issues that a rice cooker would solve would have a much better time if they just bought a flippin' rice cooker. If you eat rice regularly, then yes, a rice cooker would help. This is not a gimmick device like an egg cooker. This is how people actually cook their rice.<br /> 
<br /> 
Also, wash your rice. These are the only two rice things I will beg you to do.<br />
