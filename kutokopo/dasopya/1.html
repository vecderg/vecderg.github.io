<h2>Alphabet</h2>
<hr> 

<p>
The Dasopya alphabet consists of 18 letters (5 vowels, 13 consonants): <br />
A B D E G H I K L M N O P S T U W Y <br />
<br />
Their names are as follows: <br />
An oBa oDa En oGa oHa In oKe oLe oMa oNe On oPe oSa oTe Un oWa oYa 
</p>


<br />
<h2>Pronunciation</h2>
<hr> 

<p>
Every letter is always pronounced exactly the same regardless of context. <br />
<br />
For those that know the IPA, every letter corresponds with their IPA equivalent except for Y, which is pronounced /j/. For those that don't know the IPA, here are some English words that can be used as reference:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A like in "father"</li>
 <li>B like in "boy"</li>
 <li>D like in "dip"</li>
 <li>E like in "let"</li>
 <li>G like in "good" (never like in "gem")</li>
 <li>H like in "hole"</li>
 <li>I like in "ski"</li>
 <li>K like in "kite"</li>
 <li>L like in "log"</li>
 <li>M like in "map"</li>
 <li>N like in "nine"</li>
 <li>O like in "more"</li>
 <li>P like in "peace"</li>
 <li>S like in "sit" (never like in "pause")</li>
 <li>T like in "time"</li>
 <li>U like in "flu"</li>
 <li>W like in "win"</li>
 <li>Y like in "yes"</li>
</ul>

<p>
W and Y are primarily used as glides, and should not be emphasized when used as one. For example, "kaw" is pronounced exactly like the English word "cow," and "pey" like the word "pay."
