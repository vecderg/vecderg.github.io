<h2>Nouns</h2>
<hr> 

<p>
Nouns are words that refer to "things," whether they're living or nonliving, abstract or concrete. In this example, the nouns mentioned are: goy (thing), dey (animal), koko (rock), and hugwa (dog). However, abstract concepts like "happiness" are nouns too.<br />
<br />
In Dasopya, all nouns can be singular or plural by default, like the English word "deer" -- one deer, two deer. To make it clear, you can use "moy" (multiple) or "man" (one) before the noun. Multiple dogs would be "moy hugwa," and one dog would be "man hugwa."<br />
<br />
"Pin" can mean "this" or "these," and "san" can mean "that" or "those" depending on what they're describing. They can also be used as a noun or descriptor (the difference between "These are good" and "These dogs are good").
