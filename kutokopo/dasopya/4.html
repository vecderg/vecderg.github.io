<h2>Verbs</h2>
<hr> 

<p>
Verbs are words that primarily refer to actions, but can also refer to occurrences or states of being. In order to specify what the verb is, use the particle "i" which marks the following words as a verb phrase. <br />
<br />
Generally, the phrase that precedes "i" is assumed to be the subject of the sentence -- that is, the thing that is doing the action. For example, in "san hugwa i plu," the subject is "san hugwa" and the verb (or action) is "plu." <br />
<br />
You can also easily create verb phrases by putting verbs back to back. For example, in English, "You have to try to do it!" requires you to put "to" between every verb (have / try / do), but in Dasopya, you can just say, "kyu i subi sedi syu!" (lit. "You must try do!"). In these cases, you only need to use the particle "i" once, since all the verbs are used to modify each other.<br />
<br />
As a note, verbs in Dasopya can be any tense by default. We'll go over how to mark tense in a later lesson.<br />
