<h2>Direct Objects</h2>
<hr> 

<p>
The direct object of a sentence generally refers to the recipient of the action. For example, in the English sentence, "I love food," the action is "love" and the recipient of the love is "food".  <br />
<br />
In Dasopya, the direct object is always marked with "e," so the basic sentence structure in Dasopya has a Subject (beginning of the sentence), Verb (after the particle "i"), and Object (after the particle "e"). Sometimes the subject isn't at the beginning of the sentence (like in questions, which will be detailed later), so in those cases it should be marked with "a". Words put at the beginning of the sentence before the subject marker are usually to create some form of context. <br />
<br />
Since there's unique markers for each part of the sentence, the sentence structure can be changed in any way the user wants (a bay i milu e mabo = e mabo a bay i milu), but since this is generally saved for nonstandard artistic writing, it won't be emphasized here. Still, these sentences show how important it is to have the markers for clarity -- the particle "i" is the only difference between "mabo" meaning "to eat" and "food".<br />
<br />
On a more technical note, "e" can also mark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(linguistics)" target="_blank">complements</a>, which are not always the direct object. For example, in "I am happy," the word "happy" is not receiving "am," but is simply its complement. In Dasopya, this is still marked with "e". This is why the previous sentences (e.g. "bay e oEma") use "e"; it was the shortened version of "bay i swa e oEma".<br />
