<h2>Indirect Objects</h2>
<hr> 

<p>
Direct objects are the recipients of the action, but indirect objects are the receipients of the direct objects. If I give a gift to you, then the "gift" is the recipient of the "giving", but "you" are the recipient of the "gift". In English, indirect objects are often marked with "to", but not always ("I gave the gift to you" vs "I gave you the gift").   <br />
<br />

<h2>Possession Marker</h2>
<hr> 
<p>
"hoy" marks possession, and is translated to English as "of". "goy hoy bay" means "thing of me," or "my thing". This can also be expressed as "bay goy" since "bay" is being used as an adjective here, but "hoy" allows adjectives to be rearranged for emphasis or clarity. "kopo hoy bote" might mean the same thing as "bote kopo," but "book of blue" can be very helpful for emphasis. <br />
