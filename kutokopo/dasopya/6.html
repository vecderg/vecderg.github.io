<h2>Describing Words</h2>
<hr> 

<p>
Dasopya puts describing words before the words they describe, just like in English. In most cases (i.e. not particles, prepositions, or conjunctions), words that are put in sequence are all describing the base word in the phrase. <br />
<br />
For example, in English, if I say, "Multiple big fat grey cats walked," then all the words before "cats" are describing words for the word "cats". We only know that "walked" isn't the base word because we know "walked" is a verb. In Dasopya, the verb is separated with the particle "i" to make it clear that it isn't the base word -- "moy doy suge hede matya i sami" makes "matya" the clear base word. <br />
<br />
In English, adjectives only describe nouns, while adverbs describe verbs and adjectives. You can say that a car is "fast," but you can't say that it's moving "fastly," it's moving "quickly." However, Dasopya does not differentiate between those two. A "lase pila" is a fast bird, and "lase plu" is quickly moving.<br />
<br />
Because of this property, verbs can be modified in other ways, like for tense. "bay i mye loy" literally means "I before see," but in practice it creates the past tense -- "I saw". The future tense can be created with "dyu," which by itself means "shall" or "after". <br />
