<h2>Questions</h2>
<hr> 

<p>
The sample text has had multiple questions so far, but those were informally constructed for learning purposes. Dasopya prefers having every sentence begin with the question particle "kay," and for every unknown variable to be marked with "kya". Instead of saying "where?" you say "what place?" <br />
<br />
Unlike English, Dasopya does not change word order for questions, which may seem strange at first. For example, in English, the question might be "Why do you not have a cat?" while in Dasopya it'd be more like, "You don't have a cat for what reason?" This is because it mirrors the answer, which could be something like, "I don't have a cat because I have allergies." <br />
<br />
As an extra note, "kay" just means "question" if it's not at the beginning of a sentence. Even if it is being used as a question marker, it can be interpreted as just saying, "Question, ..." before the sentence itself. <br />
