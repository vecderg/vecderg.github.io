"What if I just put ALL my sonas into the same apartment... and they were all friends!"<br>
<br>
I was unhappy with how difficult and slow it was to develop a long-running comic, so since
I was most interested in character interaction anyway, I created a non-canon world where
everyone could be friends! The characters that appear aren't necessarily my actual sonas,
but that's a discussion for another page.<br>
<br>
SonaPartment had regular-ish comics for several weeks before it slowed down, but it's still 
getting comics whenever I get ideas. All comics can currently be found on DeviantArt until 
I move them all somewhere else.<br>

<b>CHARACTERS</b><br>
<br>
Until pages are made for EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER, please refer to this page: 
<a href="https://toyhou.se/vecderg/characters/folder:1510836" target="_blank">https://toyhou.se/vecderg/characters/folder:1510836</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Pluck - A standoffish wingless dragon, and the only one that can (barely) keep the chaotic group together.
While he might act rude, everyone knows he cares about them and just happens to have dry humor.<br>
<br>
Fidget - A goofy red panda-dragon with very bad tastes in food and fashion. His dreams of being a hero 
can be put on pause while he chills out with the boys and adjusts to the city life.<br>
<br>
Rin - Martial artist zapcat who doesn't like wearing shirts. Reasonably in tune with city living, but 
still has habits of eating cat food.<br>
<br>
Tjikko - Ferrin (by Eltalite) that doesn't actually live with the group, but in the forest. He 
likes hanging out with the group, but comes off as a bit odd, despite being very nice.<br>
<br>
Day - The newest addition to the team. A platinum fox that was "hired" on as their cook, but is a habitual
prankster. Tends to be shocked by the toony levels of goofiness of the other apartment members.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ube & Scrampy - Fidget's "pet dogs" that will definitely raid the pantry. Pluck is still unsure if 
he'll allow them to stay.<br>
<br>
Aiden - A poor college student who works at low-wage jobs. Currently works at McDonalds, despite being 
very bad at talking to people.<br>
<br>
**Other characters will have cameo appearances. Feel free to check out my
