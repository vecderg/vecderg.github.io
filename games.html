<br>

<p class="normal">
My primary occupation is a game designer! I have a large collection of games
that you can explore on my itch page, which has downloadable games and games 
that are playable in browser: 
<a href="https://vecderg.itch.io/" target="_blank">https://vecderg.itch.io/</a><br>
<br>
Despite primarily being a game designer, I touch on all aspects of game development
in my number of solo-developed projects. I'll talk about some of my favorite projects,
some of which were focused more on characters and others more on mechanics.<br>
<br>
<b>DRACOFIGHTER</b><br>
<br>
<a href="https://vecderg.itch.io/dracofighter" target="_blank"><img style="width:10em" src="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/53718523_pyaED3jWh49k5B8.png"></a><br>
<br>
If you want THE Vecderg game of all time... it's DracoFighter! <br>
<br>
This game took me about 3 years to complete in between classwork and other projects,
and as my dream project, it kind of carries a lot of my soul, if I can be dramatic.
DracoFighter is a traditional fighting game meant to bare the genre down to its
fundamentals, but without turning combat into something boring or gimmicky. It 
focuses on what makes fighting games so fun to me -- the decision-making and outplays
-- by completely doing away with complex mechanics and inputs. This makes it a 
fighting game that's really appealing to beginners!<br>
<br>
It also features hand-drawn animation of dragons, something I really wanted to be in 
the game. The story mode is meant to be silly and a bit carefree, while setting things 
up for the planned sequel...<br>
<br>

The game is available on itch, Steam, and the Google Play Store, for Windows, Mac, Linux,
and Android.  <br>
<br>
<b>DEMON'S HEIR</b><br>
<br>
<a href="https://vecderg.itch.io/demons-heir-3d" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzEyMTg3NzAwLnBuZw==/315x250%23c/%2FxCNp4.png"></a><br>
<br>
Demon's Heir is a retro-styled 3D action platformer! You play as Beewee the ninja cat,
who has incredible speed and combat prowess.<br>
<br>
This is a single-level prototype I put together for class over the course of multiple months, 
but the game idea is something I've had for a long, long time. I actually finished a 2D 
version of the game, but it's a far cry from what I imagined the final product to be, 
so I'm not really encouraging people to play it... I want to be able to make a 3D platformer 
with smooth, quick-paced movement that also integrates a simple, dramatic storyline. We'll see 
if it ever gets finished! But for now, you can play the demo in browser or by download.<br>
<br>
<b>UnderwOtter</b><br>
<br>
<a href="https://vecderg.itch.io/underwotter" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzU3NzIwMzcucG5n/315x250%23c/O33KXT.png"></a><br>
<br>
Despite visually being one of my most unpolished games, UnderwOtter is actually one of my 
favorite creations! It was made for Ludum Dare 48, where I can happily take my achievement of 
being 105th place for humor. With the theme being "Deeper", I fulfilled my childhood dream of 
having a diving game where you get treasure and exchange the money to keep going deeper...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://vecderg.itch.io/underwotter" target="_blank">Otto the Otter</a> is a separate 
game I'll be working on, but I needed to take the chance to reuse my otter protagonist for this 
swimming game! I also reused my <a href="https://vecderg.itch.io/fisherdragon" target="_blank">fishing dragon</a>
character who happened to be the perfect shopkeeper. The game loop requires you to use the most 
of your air meter to get treasure, and sell that treasure to be able to swim longer and faster. 
The fisherdragon will also ramble to you if you talk to him after upgrades, which I loved
rereading after forgetting the lines. I'm actually still shocked that I finished this game in 
just 48 hours between the map, upgrade routes, and dialogue...<br>
